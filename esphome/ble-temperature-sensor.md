### Home Assistant automations with Bluetooth LE sensors
With automations, Home Assistant can automatically respond and trigger actions based on sensor events. For example, turn on lights automatically at sunset. With motion sensors, automations can trigger turning on lights automatically when there's motion and turn lights off after no motino is detected for a set period of time.
